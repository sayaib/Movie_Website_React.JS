        <h6>
          Based on characters created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth and Mike
          Dringenberg, this series follows Lucifer, the original fallen angel,
          who has become dissatisfied with his life in hell. After abandoning
          his throne and retiring to Los Angeles, Lucifer indulges in his
          favorite things (women, wine and song) -- until a murder takes place
          outside of his upscale nightclub. For the first time in billions of
          years, the murder awakens something unfamiliar in Lucifer's soul that
          is eerily similar to compassion and sympathy. Lucifer is faced with
          another surprise when he meets an intriguing homicide detective named
          Chloe, who appears to possess an inherent goodness -- unlike the worst
          of humanity, to which he is accustomed. Suddenly, Lucifer starts to
          wonder if there is hope for his soul.
